   <p style="font-size: 22px;">Identifying native plants is significant since they form the base of the local environment and have co-evolved with native wildlife and environmental factors. Native plants offer the best food and habitat for local wildlife such as insects and birds. These plants are usually more adapted to the environment and therefore require less water and maintenance compared to non-native species. It is essential to appreciate and understand native plants since this will help us avoid the spread of invasive species, which may result in negative effects on biodiversity and ecosystems.</p>
