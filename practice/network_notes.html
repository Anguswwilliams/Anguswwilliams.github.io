<p>Today we learned about how the internet works by sending packets which go to your IP address (e.g. 11123.2435.3245) which is a unique identifier for your computer. 
The computeers in the center that transfer a bunch of packets are called routers and there is a protocall called BGP for distributing them. And finally we also saw that the packets need to have numbers so the computers know how to identify them.</p>
